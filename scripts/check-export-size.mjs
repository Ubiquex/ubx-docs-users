// Fails the build if any compressible exported file is large enough that
// CloudFront will refuse to compress it.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. CloudFront compresses objects up to 10,000,000 bytes
// and silently declines above that. There is no error, no warning, and
// nothing in the response says "too big to compress": it simply arrives
// without a content-encoding header. The only way to notice is to compare
// one page's response headers against another's.
//
// Three pages on the provider docs site were over the ceiling and shipped
// completely uncompressed for months (UBI-243). The worst served
// 11,506,319 bytes to every reader while its neighbours served brotli.
// Nothing surfaced it. This site is smaller today, which is exactly why
// the check belongs here too: nothing would say when that stopped being
// true.
// It was found only by measuring headers by hand while investigating
// something else, and the fix that resolved it was not even aimed at
// compression: a markup reduction happened to drop the page under the
// ceiling, turning an 11.5MB transfer into 432KB.
//
// So the failure mode is a 20x transfer regression that looks exactly
// like normal operation. That is what this guards.
//
// THE LIMIT IS DELIBERATELY BELOW THE REAL CEILING. Failing at
// 10,000,000 would mean failing at the moment readers are already being
// served uncompressed. Failing at 9,000,000 leaves a megabyte of slack:
// the build breaks while every page is still being compressed, and there
// is room to fix it before anyone is affected.
//
// COMPRESSIBLE TYPES ONLY. CloudFront never compresses an image or a
// font, and there is nothing to lose when it declines on one, so a large
// binary asset is not a defect and must not fail the build.
